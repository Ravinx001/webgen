# üß© Problem Statement

**Project Title:** Review Nation  
**Hackathon:** Sri Lanka Government Hackathon  
**Team:** WebGen

---

## üìå Overview

Despite advancements in e-governance, Sri Lanka currently lacks a **centralized, transparent platform** where citizens can **review and rate public services**. There is no easy way for people to give feedback on how services like hospitals, GN offices, public transport, or police stations perform on a daily basis.

---

## ‚ùó The Core Problem

- Citizens cannot publicly or privately provide structured feedback on government services.
- Government departments lack data on **citizen satisfaction** and **service quality**.
- Outstanding public servants and efficient offices are rarely recognized.
- Inefficient or corrupt services remain **unreported and unimproved**.
- There's no **accountable system** for service performance tracking.

---

## üîç Real-World Examples

- A person waiting at a Divisional Secretariat office for hours cannot report poor service.
- A well-managed local hospital receives no public praise, limiting morale and motivation.
- Issues like bribes, delays, or discrimination are often **silenced** due to lack of reporting channels.
- There‚Äôs **no digital footprint** of service quality, making nationwide improvement difficult.

---

## üö® Consequences

- **Trust in public services erodes** over time.
- **Lack of data** prevents reforms and innovation.
- **Good services go unnoticed**, while poor services remain unchanged.
- Citizens feel **disconnected and powerless**.

---

## üß≠ Why It Matters

A feedback system is the **first step toward transparency and accountability**. Just as people rate private services (Uber, PickMe, hotels), they should also be able to rate public services. This data is essential for:

- Recognizing and rewarding good service providers.
- Identifying and improving underperforming areas.
- Creating a culture of **citizen participation** in governance.

---

## ‚úÖ Opportunity

By introducing **Review Nation**, we can:
- Empower citizens to speak up.
- Help government officials make informed, data-driven decisions.
- Promote a culture of **open governance** and **service excellence** in Sri Lanka.
